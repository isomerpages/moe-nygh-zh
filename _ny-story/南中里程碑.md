<p>刘校长是一个主张女权自由、婚姻自由的女性,而提高妇女的知识是重要的事。这些因素促使她留在新加坡,决心把南洋女校办成一间最好的学校。</p>
<p>为了实践女子教育开放的宗旨,使南洋地区的女子与中国国内的女子,都享有同样平等的教育权利,刘校长和校方便设法为学生们提供财政资助,让她们继续升学。这也成为南洋大家庭一贯的传统。至今，仍有无数南洋校友不遗余力地为母校的建设和教育做贡献。刘校长也时常自豪的传扬:我们是新马最高的女学府。</p>

		<p>Many scholarships were put in place to ensure students who came from low-income families were able to continue receiving education. Poor students who were able to meet the given criteria could apply and study in the school successfully.</p>
		<p>On 16th&nbsp;of September, the Singapore Press Holdings published the “Lee Kuan Yew: 40 Years of Political Views” and held its first book premiere this year. The Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew personally autographed 30 special edition books and 150 hard cover books. These books were purchased by supporters of the school. Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew further autographed 100 more hardcover books, helping the school raise $550 00 for the school’s development fund. </p>
		<p>He said “Raising funds for Nanyang Girls’ High School is a very meaningful thing as Nanyang Girls’ High School is one of the top girls’ schools which developed into the top Special Assistance Plan girls’ school. This allows the good school culture, discipline and conduct of students of traditional Chinese schools to be preserved.”</p>
		<p>In the same year, Mrs Ong Teng Cheong was appointed Chairperson of the Board of Directors. &nbsp;Her love for the school touched many and she was the architect of the present Nanyang Primary School, Nanyang Girls’ High School and the Nanyang Boarding School campuses.</p><br></td>
